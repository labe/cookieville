### NEW IN THIS COMMIT ###

- cleaned up code calls to "return to main menu" // done in last commit, actually


### TO DO NEXT ###


- when putting cookies in the oven, only show eligible cookies (never been in an oven)
- when taking cookies out of the oven, only show eligible cookies (currently in an oven)
- cannot put cookies back into an oven once they've been taken out? (gross)

through viewer, player can:

-check bakery stats
-update player settings (bakery name, baker name, add player email, add player name?)
-read "help" file
-view individual cookie batches and status (cooked, in oven, how long in oven)
-view cookie batches by group? (uncooked, in an oven, out of an oven, etc.?)



### LONG TERM ###

- REFACTOR for MVC >>>>> (CLEAN UP CODE VOMIT AAAAAGGGGHHHHH!!!!!) <<<<<<

- think more about private methods?
- track time (every action = time spent, game/level = set time limit)
- ability to store dough in fridge/freezer (<- limited capacity, $$) ?
- assign ingredients to cookie recipes
- create kitchen pantry (database)
- cannot make cookies unless pantry contains enough of each required ingredient
- assign baker skill level based on # of successful cookie batches made?
- skill level-based recipes ("unlocking")

- bakery can have more than just a kitchen / kitchen owns the ovens (create kitchens table)
- bakery can sell cookies to earn money to buy [ingredients to make more cookies, more ovens, etc.]
- bakery can make more than just cookies (rename cookies table to 'foods' or something, keep schema)

- figure out how to allow for networked play?
- figure out how to put the database on a network
- probably look into security/password/etc. implementations because PEOPLE TAKE THEIR COOKIE DATA SERIOUSLY YO



### DONE ###

1. baker can make cookies, cookie batch is added to cookies table and assigned that baker's id
2. baker can put cookies in the oven
3. baker can remove cookies from the oven
4. oven class (read: kitchen) can bake cookies
5. cookie batch status updates based on how long it has been in the oven
6. an oven knows when it is full or not
7. cookies cannot be put into a full oven
8. cookies cannot be put into an oven if they are already in an oven
9. cookies cannot be baked if they are not in an oven
10. cookies cannot be removed from an oven if they are not in an oven
11. cookies cannot be put into an oven unless that oven is set to the correct temperature for that recipe
12. cookie status is determined by individual recipe's baking time
13. oven temp can be set
14. recipes can be printed out in a viewer-friendly format

- player "sign-in/setup" flow created
- can create player/baker-assigned batches of cookies
- made join table of oven models and bakeries ("ovens")
- menu header displaying custom bakery name
- controller = players (create players table)
- made a less improper README, moved this to CHANGELOG
- implemented "refresh screen" imitation thing for cleaner viewer output
- moved sign-in/setup code to player_sign_in_setup.rb
- FIXED RECURSION CALLS FOR MENU ERROR INPUT (I think)
- fixed bug that allowed mixed alphanum gibberish (e.g. "alj32jf") to return a recipe view
- implemented error check to prevent player from attempting certain actions if no cookie batches have been made
- implemented error check for putting cookies in oven (choosing invalid batch, choosing invalid oven)
- further improved newline viewer output stuff
- implemented error check for trying to bake or remove cookies from the oven if all ovens are empty
- fixed database seed ("ready" status -> "perfect")
- fixed README to include rake commands (necessary to make, etc. the database)

much smoother error logic for 

-cannot bake cookies if there are no batches in any ovens
-cannot change an oven's temp if the oven contains cookies
-cannot put a batch of cookies in any oven if the batch is already in an oven


through viewer, player can:

-view recipes/directions
-make cookie batches
-view all cookie batches and status (cooked, in oven)
-see all oven statuses (current temp, what it contains)
-change an oven's temp
-not change an oven's temp if the oven contains cookies
-not put a batch of cookies in any oven if the batch is already in an oven
-not bake cookies if there are no batches in any ovens
-bake cookies
-remove cookies from the oven!
-not remove cookies from the oven if the cookies are not already in an oven!
