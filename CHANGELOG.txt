9. cookies cannot be baked if they are not in an oven
10. cookies cannot be removed from an oven if they are not in an oven
11. cookies cannot be put into an oven unless that oven is set to the correct temperature for that recipe
12. cookie status is determined by individual recipe's baking time
13. oven temp can be set
14. recipes can be printed out in a viewer-friendly format

- player "sign-in/setup" flow created
- can create player/baker-assigned batches of cookies
- made join table of oven models and bakeries ("ovens")
- menu header displaying custom bakery name

through viewer, player can:

-view recipes/directions
-make cookie batches


### NEW IN THIS COMMIT ###

controller = players (create players table) // actually did this two commits ago, oops.
made a less improper README, moved this to CHANGELOG
(the README is, as of this very moment, a lie. you can't do most of what the README says you can)
implemented "refresh screen" imitation thing for cleaner viewer output

through viewer, player can:

-view all cookie batches and status (cooked, in oven)
-see all oven statuses (current temp, what it contains)
-change an oven's temp
-not change an oven's temp if the oven contains cookies
-not put a batch of cookies in any oven if the batch is already in an oven
-not bake cookies if there are no batches in any ovens
-bake cookies



### TO DO NEXT ###

- FIX RECURSION CALLS FOR ERROR INPUT (change to until/while loops?)
- move setup code to new_player.rb ?
- when putting cookies in the oven, only show cookies not in an oven
- when taking cookies out of the oven, only show cookies in an oven

through viewer, player can:

-take cookies out of oven
-check bakery stats
-update player settings (bakery name, baker name, add player email, add player name?)
-read "help" file
-view individual cookie batches and status (cooked, in oven, how long in oven)


### LONG TERM ###

- refactor for MVC >>>>> (CLEAN UP CODE VOMIT) <<<<<<
- track time (every action = time spent, game/level = set time limit)
- ability to store dough in fridge/freezer (<- limited capacity, $$) ?
- assign ingredients to cookie recipes
- create kitchen pantry (database)
- cannot make cookies unless pantry contains enough of each required ingredient
- assign baker skill level based on # of successful cookie batches made?
- skill level-based recipes ("unlocking")

- bakery can have more than just a kitchen / kitchen owns the ovens (create kitchens table)
- bakery can sell cookies to earn money to buy [ingredients to make more cookies, more ovens, etc.]
- bakery can make more than just cookies (rename cookies table to 'foods' or something, keep schema)

- figure out how to allow for networked play?
- figure out how to put the database on a network
- probably look into security/password/etc. implementations because PEOPLE TAKE THEIR COOKIE DATA SERIOUSLY YO
